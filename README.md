# Pump it Up

**Challenge description:** Predict the functionality of Tanzania's waterpoints. They are either functional, functional but needs repair, or non-functional. This is a classification problem.

**Steps:**
1. Exploratory data analysis - identify important variables
2. Data preprocessing - select variables that are important; reduce factor levels of variables with too many levels
3. Classification trees - tried various classification trees including random forest and boosting

p.s. I am thankful that I chanced upon this organization - DrivenData- that constantly holds Data Science competition for the world's problems. Do check out other competitions that they hold and make your mark! They have several practice level competitions and this is one of them.

As this is my first project using R, please pardon the lengthy codes. Do give me feedback on my codes as well.
